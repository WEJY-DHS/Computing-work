# Memories

### I still remember the first time I met you. I still remember my first impression of you -- that you were going to be another ordinary, average teacher. However, as they 
always say, never judge a book by its cover. And you, Ms Low, are certainly one of a kind.
With your older-fashioned way of thinking, I was preparing myself for many days of slow, boring Math lessons soon to come. Moreover, as Math was one of my weaker subjects in 
Primary school, I dreaded the first Math lesson of the year. I worried about disliking the Math lesson, but mostly about not being able to catch up during Math lessons, like in 
Primary school.
#### I soon found out from the Math lessons to come, however, that you had a quirky personality. With your famous quotes such as "no arc no mark", "one fraction on the left, 
one fraction on the right", you really cracked the whole class up and made the whole lesson experience much more interesting and enjoyable. I laughed everytime you commented on 
the boys' handwriting, saying that they were not going to be able to court girls in the future because of that. Just seeing the awkward expressions on their faces just made me 
smile even more. "No arc no mark" was also one of your famous quotes, and it worked so effectively on me that I always remembered to draw an arc after that. "One fraction on the left, one fraction on the right" was another effective quote, where your voice would echo in my head whenever I faced this type of question. Another memorable time was when you gave us snacks to award us for doing well during PCD.
